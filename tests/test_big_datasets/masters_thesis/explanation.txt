The three data sets used in the experiment are included as csv-files.

All other files are Jupyter Notebooks using Python. 

There are three general files:
Data_preparation: prepares the raw data sets
Classes: defines objects used by all algorithms, such as Case and CB
Feature selection: algorithm to reduce the number of features

The other three files are devoted to specific methods:
AA-CBR, AF-CBA and the four algorithms discussed in CH7.
